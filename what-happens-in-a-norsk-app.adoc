== What a Norsk-Live application does


* [.big .aqua]#Defines audio and video input streams#
** Location (ip address) to which each stream is published
** Encoding type
** Other source-specific configuration details
* [.big .aqua]#Informs the Norsk Server about these inputs and where to deliver them#
** the location of this server needs to be specified in code
** Plus a set of encodings that should be delivered to those targets
** Also a ladder of quality levels
* [.big .aqua]#Specifies in real-time#
** which input streams should be published to the delivery target(s)
*** ..i.e. switching between cameras
** whether any special effect should be applied
*** ...for example, whether one video stream should partially overlay another
* [.big .aqua]#Reacts to messages from the Norsk Server#
** for example, Norsk will inform the client app after it has received and validated an input stream definition (referred to in the first line of this list)
** Client code must acknowledge server messages.
