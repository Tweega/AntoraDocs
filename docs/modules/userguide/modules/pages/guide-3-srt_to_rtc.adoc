== Another simple example

Instead of using rtmp as a signal source, the following example uses srt.  (xref:NodeSettings.adoc[configuring the Norst playground for an srt source]) 

[source,TypeScript]
----
async function srt_to_rtc(argv: Arguments): Promise<void> {
  let srtInputSettings = {
    id: "srtInput",
    ip: argv.ip,
    port: argv.port,
    mode: SrtMode.PUSH,
    sourceName: "camera1",
  };

  let localRtcSettings = {
    id: "localRtcOutput",
    numVideoStreams: 1,
  };

  const norsk = new Norsk(baseUrl());
  let input = await norsk.input.srt(srtInputSettings);
  let localRtcOutput = await norsk.output.localWebRTC(localRtcSettings);
  localRtcOutput.subscribe([{ source: input, sourceSelector: selectAV }]);

}
----

As you can see, it is almost the same as our first example (rtmp_to_rtc), except that we are using a different video transmission protocol (srt) and therefore have different config to do - *and* we also call the srt constructor function on the norsk object, instead of rtmp.  This code can be found in srt_to_rtc in main.tss
